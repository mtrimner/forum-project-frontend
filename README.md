# Form Project Front-end

This is a single page app modeled after a reddit/forum style web application. This was created as a way to learn Javascript for FlatIron schools software engineering program. You may notice some odd design choices such as rendering HTML in multiple different ways or odd use of callbacks. This was done as a way for me to experiment with different concepts in javascript and to gain a better understanding of javascript works.

You can find the rails backend here: https://github.com/mtrimner/forum-project-backend
